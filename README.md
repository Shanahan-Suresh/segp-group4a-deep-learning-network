# HeatGen (Deep Learning Neural Network)

The aim of this project is to build a tool that is able to help researchers study new heat
absorbing materials for pavements via a multi-layered neural network, when given only a set of physical variables.


## Application Information

### Dependencies

* Required Python libraries : PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Pillow
* Only tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11

### Installing via executable
